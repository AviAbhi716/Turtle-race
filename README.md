# Turtle-race Game

This is a fun Turtle Race Game created using Python's turtle module. The game allows the user to select the number of racing turtles (between 2 and 10). Each turtle is randomly assigned a unique color and starts from the bottom of the race track.

How It Works:

1. The user chooses how many turtles will participate in the race.
2. Each turtle is randomly colored and positioned at the starting line.
3. The turtles race upwards toward the finish line at varying speeds.
4. The first turtle to cross the finish line is declared the winner, and its color is displayed.
   
The game uses random speeds and distances for each turtle, making every race unpredictable and exciting! The race continues until a winner is determined, and the game screen closes when clicked.
